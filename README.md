# HR Database using MySQL
I practiced my SQL skill using HR Database.
In this database, there are 2 tables. The office table contains information about offices. The employee table has information about people working in offices. There is 1 to  many relationships from offices to employees table. The employee table also has 1 too many relationships with itself.

I have written SQL queries to find out information about employees. 

#### 1) Find the information of employees with their salary less than 50K.

#### 2) Employees with their first name starting with the letter N.

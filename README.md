## Introduction

Welcome to the HR Data Analysis project! This repository houses the documentation, SQL queries, and code for a comprehensive analysis of an HR dataset using MySQL. This project aims to provide valuable insights into various aspects of human resources, such as employee performance, attrition, and more.

## Objective
